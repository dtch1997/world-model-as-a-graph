## Overview

![image info](./figures/l3p.png)

Model-based RL agents today plan using step-by-step virtual rollouts in a learned dynamics model. 
This type of world model quickly diverges from reality as the planning horizon increases. 
Humans, however, can do planning by **analyzing the structure of a problem in the large** 
and **decomposing it into simpler sub-problems**. 
How can we teach learning agents to do something similar? 

We enhance RL agentsâ€™ ability to do temporally extended reasoning by learning a graph-structured world model 
composed of sparse, multi-step transitions. 
We show how to **learn both the nodes and the edges** on the graph together with a goal-conditioned policy, 
and how to better leverage **temporal abstraction** in online planning.

## Instructions

 is provided in the `rl` folder.

The training scripts are provided in `scripts` folder. 

## Quickstart

To play an existing model:
```
source scripts/test_pointmaze.sh
```
To visualize the landmarks, use `rl.main_latent_viz_landmarks` instead of `rl.main_latent`

To train a new model: 
```
source scripts/train_pointmaze.sh
```
